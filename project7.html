  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project was really whimsical, a real limit tester too. I'm not the best coder, I ended up getting stuck and giving up several 
    times throughout this entire thing, especially when my previous ideas were falling flat. 
    But overall I'm pretty satisfied with how this one turned out. I enjoyed pixelizing my own Sims and getting them involved in this project.
