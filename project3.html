  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This one was pretty alright. I did this at a point where I really didn't understand how to get creative 
    with my code (I still don’t really know), so I just kept it as simple as possible. I used to swim, so I 
    figured this could be a fun and somewhat accurate way of displaying time. Now, I don’t think I could do 
    a full lap in 20 seconds, but I'm sure someone can.
