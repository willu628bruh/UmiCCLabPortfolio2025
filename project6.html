  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
This project is meant to display the different genres of music I listened to in a week. One of my most listened to genres of music is Electronic, 
and if you know about electronic music, you'll know it has literally hundreds of subgenres. So, to narrow it down, I pinpointed which subgenres 
I listened to most each day for a week. EDM on Monday, Footwork on Tuesday, Bruxaria on Wednesday, Dariacore on Thursday, 
Electro House on Friday, Mashup on Saturday, and Jungle on Monday. I had a lot of fun listening to the music, not so much the coding, unfortunately.

Weirdly, I’m kinda thankful I did this later in the semester. I've got a lot better at executing my ideas, even though I had quite a bit of help.
