  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Going off my partner’s description was something I thought would be very easy. 
    He was pretty merciful for giving me the prompt he did. BUT... this being my 
    second time using p5.js made it a bit of a challenge. I ended up on other people’s 
    p5 projects, getting inspiration through their code and trying my best to implement 
    it in mine. Using the vertex made me never want to do that again, though.
